            <h1>Mammals</h1>
            <p>The world's three great groups of mammals: monotremes, marsupials and placentals are all found in Australia. <strong>Monotremes</strong> are egg-laying mammals (nowadays found only in Australia and New Guinea).<strong> Marsupials</strong> have babies born in embryonic condition and kept firmly attached to a teat  in a pouch or nestled behind a protective skin-flap while developing further.<strong> Placentals</strong> have unborn young nourished by a placenta (just to confuse things, some marsupials also have a placenta) and born at a more advanced stage, some still naked, blind and unable to walk for a week or two, others able to run on their day of birth. A total of 379 species of mammals have been recorded in Australia and surrounding continental waters; 357 indigenous and 22 introduced.</p>
